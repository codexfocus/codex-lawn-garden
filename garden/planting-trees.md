### Planting a Tree

#### Steps for planting a new tree
- dig a wide large hole. Not so much deep as wide, triple the size of the root ball wide.
- break up the root ball, breaking/cutting it straight away from the center of the tree/trunk out. Make sure no roots are wrapped up around the crown.
- bury up to the crown with the top of the crown exposed.
- mulch out several feet.
  
#### After planting
- Stake the tree the first year, at least three stakes and tie down.
- water three times a week, you can cut back watering towards the end of the summer and it is more established.
- in colder areas wrap the tree trunk in a white covering to prevent freeze/thaw cycle in winter/early spring (do this for the first 3 to 4 years until the trunk is 4 or 5 inches in diameter).
